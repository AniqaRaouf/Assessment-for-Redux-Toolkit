Test Requirement Question:
As part of our evaluation process, we'd like you to complete a coding task using React Native.
The task involves creating a basic mobile application that allows users to register, login, submit it,
and display the entered text. You are required to implement the following functionalities:
1. Input Field: Utilize the component to allow users to input text. Ensure that the input field
is styled appropriately and provides a placeholder text for guidance.
2. Button: Implement a button using the button component that, when pressed, updates
the display with the text entered by the user. Ensure that the button is visually
distinguishable and provides clear feedback upon pressing.
3. State Management: Use redux to manage the state of the input text and the displayed
text. Ensure that changes in the input field and button press events correctly update the
component's state.
4. Display Text: Display the entered text below the input field, indicating to the user what
they have submitted. Ensure that the displayed text is styled appropriately for readability.
5. Code Structure and Readability: Organize your code in a clear and understandable
manner. Pay attention to variable naming, indentation, and commenting where necessary
to enhance code readability and maintainability.
